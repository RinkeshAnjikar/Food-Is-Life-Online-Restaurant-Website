        <p class="food">Food always feels like luxury when youâ€™re hungry.</p>
        <p class="container">If your blood sugar drops you might feel tired, irritable and depressed. Eating regularly and choosing foods that release energy slowly will help to keep your sugar levels steady. Slow-release energy foods include: pasta, rice, oats, wholegrain
            bread and cereals, nuts and seeds.</p>
        <p class="container">Food is what people and animals eat to live. Every organism needs energy to carry on with the process of living which comes from food. Food usually comes from animals and plants. It is eaten by living things to provide energy and nutrition. Vegetables
            and fruit contain a lot of the minerals, vitamins and fibre we need to keep us physically and mentally healthy. Eating a variety of different coloured fruits and vegetables every day means you'll get a good range of nutrients Food contains
            the nutrition that people and animals need to be healthy. The consumption of food is normally enjoyable to humans. . It contains protein, fat, carbohydrates, vitamins, water and minerals. Liquids used for energy and nutrition are often called
            "drinks". If someone cannot afford food they go hungry.Food produced by farmers or gardeners can be changed by industrial processes (the food industry). Processed food usually contains several natural ingredients and food additives (such as
            preservatives, antioxidants, emulsifiers, flavor enhancers). For example, bread is processed food. Food processing at home is done in the kitchen, by the cook. The cook sometimes uses a cookbook. Examples of cooking utensils are pressure cookers,
            pots, and frying pans. Food can also be prepared and served in restaurants or refectory (in particular for children in school). The utensils used may be a plate, knife, fork, chopsticks, spoon, bowl, or spork. Many people do not grow their
            own food. They have to buy food that was grown by someone else. People buy most of their food in shops or markets. But some people still grow most or all of their own food.</p>
